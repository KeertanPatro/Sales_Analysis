# Sales_Analysis

We have a Sales transactions data of a retail store this dataset consists of 125000 entries and three columns customer_id, transaction date, transaction amount.
In addition to this dataset we also have another dataset which tells us about customer's response to those purchase. Our objective for this project is to identify customer behavioriol insights, customer segementation, sales patterns and time seriers analysis of the sales. I firt cleaned the data checked for missing values and duplicates values and made treatmeent accordingly. I tranformed the data mainly the date variable to data time format and extracted various components such as month, year from it. After cleaning the data i found the insights from it.  

### Insights
